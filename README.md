Entry for the "SHMUP Love Month Jam" https://itch.io/jam/shmup-love-month-jam

Its an arcade-inspired shoot-em-up, with a puzzle-like upgrade system. Fight your way through procedurally generated waves of enemies and acquire circuits to upgrade your ship.

There is no end or final boss since each level is randomly generated.  See how far you can go. The balance gets pretty crazy around world 4-5.

Controls:

    WASD - to control your ship
    SPACE - to shoot
    E - to change between shooting patterns
    SHIFT - to fly at a constant slow speed (Focus mode)
    Use your mouse to drag and drop circuits on the right panel
